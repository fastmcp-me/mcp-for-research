## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Through AI Assistants (Easiest - No Setup Required)
If you're not comfortable with technical setup, you can use this tool through AI assistants like:
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) 
- **Cursor** (Code editor with AI)

These assistants can use this tool to help you find research papers without any setup on your part.

### Option 2: Set Up MCP on Your Computer (For Advanced Users)
This option lets you use the tool directly with AI assistants on your computer. It's like giving your AI assistant a special tool to find research papers.

## Setting Up MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is like a "language" that lets AI assistants talk to tools on your computer. Think of it like installing a special app that your AI assistant can use.

### What You Need
- **A computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **An AI assistant** that supports MCP (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or others)
- **Basic computer skills** (downloading files, running programs)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Download the tool**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aringadre76/mcp-for-research.git
   cd mcp-for-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the tool**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure your AI assistant**
   - Find "MCP Servers" or "Tools" in your AI assistant's settings
   - Add a new MCP server
   - Set the command to: `node dist/index.js`
   - Set the working directory to your project folder

5. **Test the setup**
   ```bash
   npm run test:all-tools-bash
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Search for Papers
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "research_search",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "machine learning",
      "sources": ["pubmed", "arxiv"],
      "maxResults": 15,
      "startDate": "2020/01/01"
    }
  }
}
```

### Analyze a Paper
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "paper_analysis",
    "arguments": {
      "identifier": "12345678",
      "analysisType": "complete",
      "maxQuotes": 20
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Citations
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "citation_manager",
    "arguments": {
      "identifier": "12345678",
      "action": "all",
      "format": "apa"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of the Consolidated Approach

✅ **80% reduction** in tool count (24 → 5)  
✅ **Easier to remember** and use  
✅ **More powerful** - multiple operations in single calls  
✅ **Better performance** - fewer tool registrations  
✅ **Easier maintenance** - less code duplication  
✅ **Consistent interface** - similar parameter patterns  

## Migration from Previous Version

The consolidated tools are **backward compatible** - you can still access the same functionality, just through fewer, more powerful tools. Each consolidated tool accepts parameters that let you specify exactly what you want to do.

| Old Tool | New Tool | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `search_papers` | `research_search` | Use `sources: ["pubmed"]` |
| `get_paper_by_id` | `paper_analysis` | Use `analysisType: "basic"` |
| `get_full_text` | `paper_analysis` | Use `analysisType: "full-text"` |
| `get_citation` | `citation_manager` | Use `action: "generate"` |
| `set_source_preference` | `research_preferences` | Use `action: "set", category: "source"` |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The tool doesn't start**
A: Make sure you've run `npm install` and `npm run build` first.

**Q: My AI assistant can't find the tools**
A: Check that the MCP server path is correct in your AI assistant's settings.

**Q: Searches return no results**
A: Try different search terms or check if your sources are enabled in preferences.

**Q: How do I get papers in a specific format?**
A: Use the citation tools to get the paper in the format you need (APA, MLA, etc.).
